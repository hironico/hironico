ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nicolas,

Currently pursuing a perfect blend of style and technologies for a wide range of organizations. 
For the past 21 years I've helped global companies, organizations and start-ups reach business goals with user focused, innovative IT design. 
I enjoy bringing clarity to complex problems with a people first approach.

I am a complete tech courious animal. Find some of my work on GitHub. Follow me on Instagram & 500px.
